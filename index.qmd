## Welcome!

This website is for people interested in learning more about the QGreenland

Rendezvous](https://ciresevents.colorado.edu/rendezvous/) under the
"Communications, Policy, Outreach, Education" theme.

## Abstract

This poster highlights the successes and challenges of educational workshops
facilitated by the QGreenland team in 2023. QGreenland is an NSF-funded
initiative to improve accessibility and usability of geospatial data related to
Greenland. The QGreenland data package is a curated collection of online and
offline interdisciplinary data intended for use with QGIS, a geospatial analysis
and visualization suite like ArcGIS, but free and open-source.QGreenland has
developed resources such as workshops and tutorials to make QGreenland
easy-to-use by the general public. Video tutorials and how-to guides are
available for new and advanced GIS users. Moreover, curricula have been
developed to use QGreenland in high-school and undergraduate classrooms for
teaching about Greenland.

In addition to these resources, the QGreenland team has developed and
facilitated virtual and in-person workshops that target new, intermediate, and
advanced GIS users and researchers. This poster details our experiences with
facilitating these workshops and includes recommendations for other workshop
planners. In April 2023, the QGreenland team conducted in-person workshops in
Denmark and Greenland that focused on beginner and intermediate GIS skills. In
May, a virtual researcher workshop focused on best practices for geospatial data
management. Finally, a workshop focused on educators was conducted in June. In
addition, the poster touches on educational materials currently in development
and planned for the next few years as part of a new collaboration with the
Arctic Data Center (ADC), titled QGreenland-Net.
